    "Up to now we have mainly used this session to introduce how to produce visuals of data. This is important but there is also the analysis of images and other multimedia. Next, we talk therefore about a few simple exercises to work with images. We will see that basic image manipulation is actually quite simple because images are matrixes and can be manipulated just like any other matrix. You might remember matrixes from the introductions? If not, it is good to look them up again. They are similar to dataframes but simpler. They contain only one type for all columns. In the case of images, these are pixel values.\n",

Check out https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pillow/python_pillow_colors_on_an_image.htm for a detailed explanation and especially the red, green and blue colour coding. A combination of RGB defines any colour for the human eye. This means we need to store all pixels of the image according to its height and width axes and this has to happen three times, because we need one matrix for each RGB colour channel. We need one matrix each for red, green and blue. This leads to a three-dimensional matrix: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image).\n",
