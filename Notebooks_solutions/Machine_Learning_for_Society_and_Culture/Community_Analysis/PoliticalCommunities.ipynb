    "Today, we start exploring political and social community data using a popular exploration technique with association mining like clustering. It is very effective and easy to use. We will gain some real insights about US politics as well as communities in social networking sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another focus today will be to introduce you to the problems of real life social datasets, which often lack the quality to be processed easily. For instance, you will learn various strategies of dealing with missing entries either by removing them completely or by trying to replicate its values. The kind of social data we are dealing with is vast and unorganized, which makes organizing it for analysis no easy task. In reality, you will spend most of your time on working through such data challenges. \n",

Some people consider data exploration to be the most important part in the data analysis process, as it is really important to understand each aspect of the data and the way it is represented. In social and cultural analytics, most of our work is based on data exploration techniques rather than prediction. We will cover prediction later in the course. \n",

    "In this section, we concentrate on introducing the power of digital methodologies and data exploration using a particular method called clustering, which is closely related to the understanding of political and social communities. We will look at the basics of clustering that delivers you powerful results very fast. In particular, we will use the k-means algorithm, which was invented by MacQueen in the late 1960s (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). Despite being ancient in terms of computer lives, k-means is still widely used as it delivers good results with great performance. Performance in computing describes the effort we need in terms of computational resources. You will generally notice performance by the execution time. \n",
